Customer Churn Prediction

his project analyzes customer churn by examining various service usage patterns, payment preferences, and customer demographics. The dataset includes details such as customer ID, gender, senior citizen status, partnership status, dependents, and tenure. It also captures the services subscribed (e.g., phone, internet, streaming) and payment arrangements (contract type, paperless billing, payment method, monthly and total charges). Extensive data cleaning, univariate, and bivariate analysis were performed to uncover key insights. To predict customer churn effectively, machine learning models like Decision Tree and Random Forest were implemented. This project provides valuable insights into customer retention strategies and helps businesses reduce churn rates. ðŸš€
